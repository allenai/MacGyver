MacGyver is a dataset consisting of over 1,600 **real-world verbal problems** deliberately designed to trigger **innovative usage of objects** and **necessitate out-of-the-box thinking**. Our dataset covers diverse topics, ranging from indoors/household, neutral, to outdoors. Some examples include:

**[Additional Solution-Annotation Pair]** In addition to the problem statements and correct solutions, we release human annotations for all the machine/human solutions tested in benchmarking. We hope these additional 4,100 answer-annotation pairs, containing a full gradient of correctness (completely wrong, partially correct, correct but less efficient, and perfect), will facilitate future works in automatic evaluation.

## Quick Start with Python Package
To swiftly utilize our model, install our Python package using the following command:
```sh
pip install glen
```
Afterwards, download the model [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UU1UVPpYypRh5dPUhQ8TreAJd-uoLEh7/view?usp=sharing) and unzip them on your local machine.
Below is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use glen for event detection:
```python
from glen import event_detection

# Create a list of sentences you wish to analyze
sentence_list = ['One Air Force technician died and 21 others were injured.']

# Run event detection
result = event_detection(sentence_list, 'your_path_to/ckpts', bs_TI=64, bs_TC=64, bs_TR=4, k=10)

# Output the result
print(result)
```
- Parameters:
  - `bs_TI`, `bs_TC`, and `bs_TR`: Adjust these batch sizes for different modules based on the available memory of your computational device.
  - `k`: Specifies the number of candidate types considered by the type classifier.

The output will be presented as a list of JSON-formatted event detection results for each sentence. For example, the output for the above code snippet will appear as follows:
```yaml
[{
  'sen_id': 0, 
  'sentence': 'One Air Force technician died and 21 others were injured.', 
  'predicted_mentions': [
    {
      'sentence_offset': [25, 29], 
      'trigger_words': 'died', 
      'trigger_confidence': 0.9814410209655762, 'event_type': {
        'xpo_node': 'DWD_Q267505', 
        'name': 'dying', 
        'description': 'final process of life'
      }, 
      'event_confidence': 0.8992632031440735
    }, 
    {
      'sentence_offset': [49, 56], 
      'trigger_words': 'injured', 
      'trigger_confidence': 0.9866828918457031, 
      'event_type': {
        'xpo_node': 'DWD_Q1064904', 
        'name': 'major_trauma', 
        'description': 'injury that could cause prolonged disability or death'
      }, 
      'event_confidence': 0.8462748527526855
    }
  ]
}]
```


## Data Format
Each data file in `./data/data_split` is in JSON format and contains a list of data instances. Below is an example of a training instance:
```yaml
{ 
    "id": "propbank_15251", # A unique identifier for the sentence
    "document": "propbank_15251", # Source document of the sentence
    "s_id": 0, # Order of the sentence in the source document
    "domain": "propbank", # Source domain
    "sentence": "he had worked with mr. mcdonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center .", # The original sentence text
    "events": [ # List of events in the sentence
        {
            "trigger": ["worked"], # Words in the sentence that trigger the event
            "offset": [2], # Offset positions of the trigger words
            "pb_roleset": "work.01" # The associated PropBank roleset for this event
        }, 
        {
            "trigger": ["recruited"], 
            "offset": [11], 
            "pb_roleset": "recruit.01"
        }
    ],
    "merged_from": "propbank_15251&ontonotes/nw/wsj/14/wsj_1455_58" # Optional attribute indicating merger of instances from different sources
}
```
And here is an example of an annotated test instance:
```yaml
{
    "id": "NapierDianne_183", 
    "document": "./propbank-release/data/oanc/masc/spoken/00/NapierDianne.gold_conll", 
    "s_id": 183, 
    "domain": "./propbank-release/data/oanc/masc", 
    "sentence": "and we would order one pizza and all share it /", 
    "events": [
        {
            "trigger": ["order"], 
            "offset": [3], 
            "pb_roleset": "order.02",
            "candidate_nodes": ['DWD_Q1779371', 'DWD_Q2556572', 'DWD_Q566889'], # List of event nodes mapping to the ProbBank roleset 
            "annotation": [ # If multiple candidate nodes exist, annotators select the most suitable event type
                {
                    'label': 'order: stated intention to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services', 
                    'worker': 'A3PQ5TK771LX04'
                }, 
                {
                    'label': 'order: stated intention to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services', 
                    'worker': 'AMRYNBWDDIVDE'
                }
            ],  
            "xpo_label": "DWD_Q566889" # Annotation result
        }, 
        {
            "trigger": ["share"], 
            "offset": [8], 
            "pb_roleset": "share.01", 
            "candidate_nodes": ["DWD_Q459221"], 
            "xpo_label": "DWD_Q459221"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Reproduction
### Setup
```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ZQS1943/GLEN.git
    cd GLEN
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Predict

To predict on your own data, download our [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UU1UVPpYypRh5dPUhQ8TreAJd-uoLEh7/view?usp=sharing), place it under `your_path_to/GLEN/`, and execute the example commands provided:
```sh
unzip ckpts.zip
bash scripts/predict_sentence.sh
```

### Data Preparation
Download [AMR](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2020T02) and [OntoNotes](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19) and place them under `your_path_to/GLEN/data/source_data/`. Ensure the following directory structure:
```sh
source_data
    -LDC2019E81_Abstract_Meaning_Representation_AMR_Annotation_Release_3.0
        -data
        -docs
    -ontonotes-release-5.0
        -data
        -docs
        -tools
```
Then run the following code to map the sentence and preprocess and data:
```sh
export PYTHONPATH=./
python3 data/data_preparation/map_data.py
python3 data/data_preparation/data_preprocessing.py
```

### Model Training

Our model consists of three components: Trigger Identification, Type Ranking, and Type Classification. To train these models, use the provided scripts:

![Overview of the framework](asset/model.png)

To train the Trigger Identification model:
```sh
bash scripts/train_trigger_identification.sh
```
To train the Type Ranking model:
```sh
bash scripts/train_type_ranking.sh
```
Before we train Type Classification model, we need to get the top k event types for each sentence in the train set predicted by the trained Type Ranking model. To get this, use the following command:
```sh
bash scripts/predict_type_ranking.sh train_set
# param1: the predicting data
```
For training the Type Classification model, we adopt an incremental self-labeling procedure to handle the partial labels. Please refer to Section 3.3 of the paper for more details. To train a base classifier, use the following command:
```sh
bash scripts/train_type_classifier.sh 0 ./exp/type_ranking/epoch_4/train_data_for_TC.json
# param1: the model number 
# param2: the path to the training data
```
After the base classifier is trained, we use this model to self-label the train set with the following command:
```sh
bash scripts/predict_type_classifier.sh 0 train_set ./exp/type_ranking/epoch_4/train_data_for_TC.json
# param1: the model number
# param2: the predicting data
# param3: the path to the training data
```
Then, we use the self-labeled train set to retrain the Type Classification model using the command below:
```sh
bash scripts/train_type_classifier.sh 1 ./exp/type_classifier_0/epoch_1/train_data_for_TC.json
# param1: the model number 
# param2: the path to the training data
```

### Evaluate

To evaluate the entire piprline, use these commands:
```sh
bash scripts/predict_trigger_identification.sh
bash scripts/predict_type_ranking.sh test_set
# param1: the predicting data
bash scripts/predict_type_classifier.sh 1 test_set
# param1: the model number
# param2: the predicting data
```

## Docker
You can also use Docker to run the GLEN server:
```sh
docker pull qiusi/glen_sentence # pull the image
docker run --gpus all -p 5000:5000 qiusi/glen_sentence # Start the GLEN server
```
