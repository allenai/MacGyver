Use the pencil (sharpen it with the chisel if needed) to draw a straight line along the ruler. This line represents the specific angle you need.\n\nStep 5.

Use the tomato stakes to mark the intended path of the maze by placing them at regular intervals along the desired route.\n\nStep 2. Clear snow with the leaf blower:\nAlthough the leaf blower has low power, it can still help you clear some snow. Begin by using the leaf blower to blow away the snow from the areas between the tomato stakes to create the maze's path. You may need to go over the same areas multiple times, given the low power of the blower.\n\nStep 3. Use the metal rake for fine adjustments:\nWhile the metal rake is rusted and might not be ideal, you can use it for more precise snow adjustments. Gently push the rake to shape and fine-tune the maze path. Be cautious not to apply too much force to prevent damaging the rake.\n\nStep 4. Lift and place the grill grating:\nAlthough the grill grating is heavy, you can use it as a bridge or an obstacle within the maze. If it's too heavy to lift, try using the tomato stakes or some other items to prop it up slightly, allowing you to slide it into position without having to lift the entire weight.\n\nStep 5. Repair the torn tarp:\nIf the tarp has a tear, you can attempt to repair it using some waterproof tape or by sewing it back together with a needle and thread. Place the tarp over the maze path and secure it in place using the tomato stakes to create walls or barriers.\n\nStep 6. Final adjustments:\nUse the leaf blower, rake, and tomato stakes to make final adjustments to the maze path and the barriers created with the tarp.
